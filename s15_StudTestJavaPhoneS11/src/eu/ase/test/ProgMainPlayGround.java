// Mark 4:
// Beside the JUnit 4 framework running for the official mark,
// please do your own minimal testing - e.g. create an instance from SmartPhone and call methods in main method from ProgMainPlayGround class:
// createPhones or readPhones from Utils class, sockets objects, etc.
// DO NOT spend too much time here - No requirements and a lot of testing code is already into JUnit4 framework
public class ProgMainPlayGround {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
	}

}
